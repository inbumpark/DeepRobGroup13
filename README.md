**DEâ«¶TR**: End-to-End Object Detection with Transformers
========

[![Support Ukraine](https://img.shields.io/badge/Support-Ukraine-FFD500?style=flat&labelColor=005BBB)](https://opensource.fb.com/support-ukraine)

PyTorch training code and pretrained models for **DETR** (**DE**tection **TR**ansformer).
We replace the full complex hand-crafted object detection pipeline with a Transformer, and match Faster R-CNN with a ResNet-50, obtaining **42 AP** on COCO using half the computation power (FLOPs) and the same number of parameters. Inference in 50 lines of PyTorch.

**What it is**. Unlike traditional computer vision techniques, DETR approaches object detection as a direct set prediction problem. It consists of a set-based global loss, which forces unique predictions via bipartite matching, and a Transformer encoder-decoder architecture. 
Given a fixed small set of learned object queries, DETR reasons about the relations of the objects and the global image context to directly output the final set of predictions in parallel. Due to this parallel nature, DETR is very fast and efficient.

**About the code**. We believe that object detection should not be more difficult than classification,
and should not require complex libraries for training and inference.
DETR is very simple to implement and experiment with, and we provide a
[standalone Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/facebookresearch/detr/blob/colab/notebooks/detr_demo.ipynb)
showing how to do inference with DETR in only a few lines of PyTorch code.
Training code follows this idea - it is not a library,
but simply a [main.py](main.py) importing model and criterion
definitions with standard training loops.

Additionnally, we provide a Detectron2 wrapper in the d2/ folder. See the readme there for more information.

# Model Zoo
We provide baseline DETR and DETR-DC5 models, and plan to include more in future.
AP is computed on COCO 2017 val5k, and inference time is over the first 100 val5k COCO images,
with torchscript transformer.

COCO val5k evaluation results can be found in this [gist](https://gist.github.com/szagoruyko/9c9ebb8455610958f7deaa27845d7918).

The models are also available via torch hub,
to load DETR R50 with pretrained weights simply do:
```python
model = torch.hub.load('facebookresearch/detr:main', 'detr_resnet50', pretrained=True)
```

# Usage - Object detection
There are no extra compiled components in DETR and package dependencies are minimal,
so the code is very simple to use. We provide instructions how to install dependencies via conda.
First, clone the repository locally:
```
git clone https://github.com/inbumpark/DeepRobGroup13.git
```
Then, install PyTorch 1.5+ and torchvision 0.6+:
```
conda install -c pytorch pytorch torchvision
```
Install pycocotools (for evaluation on COCO) and scipy (for training):
```
conda install cython scipy
pip install -U 'git+https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi.git#subdirectory=PythonAPI'
```
That's it, should be good to train and evaluate detection models.


## Data preparation

Download the DAWN dataset and split into train, val, test folders. Annotations are given in the annotations folder.
[https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/766ygrbt8y/3](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/766ygrbt8y/3).
We expect the directory structure to be the following:
```
path/to/coco/
  annotations/  # annotation json files
  train/    # train images
  val/      # val images
  test/     # test images
```

## Training
To train baseline DETR on a single node with 2 gpus for 1000 epochs run (estimated training time is ~12 hours):
```
python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=2 --use_env main.py --coco_path path/to/coco --output_dir ./ckpts --epochs 1000 --lr_drop 400
```

We train DETR with AdamW setting learning rate in the transformer to 1e-4 and 1e-5 in the backbone.
Horizontal flips, scales and crops are used for augmentation.
Images are rescaled to have min size 800 and max size 1333.
The transformer is trained with dropout of 0.1, and the whole model is trained with grad clip of 0.1.


## Evaluation
To evaluate DETR R50 on COCO val5k with a single GPU run:
```
python main.py --batch_size 2 --no_aux_loss --eval --resume https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/detr/detr-r50-e632da11.pth --coco_path /path/to/coco
```
We provide results for all DETR detection models in this
[gist](https://gist.github.com/szagoruyko/9c9ebb8455610958f7deaa27845d7918).
Note that numbers vary depending on batch size (number of images) per GPU.
Non-DC5 models were trained with batch size 2, and DC5 with 1,
so DC5 models show a significant drop in AP if evaluated with more
than 1 image per GPU.
